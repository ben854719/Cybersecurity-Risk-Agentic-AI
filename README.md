Project: Cybersecurity Risk Agentic AI.

Summary:

The project aims to demonstrate the risks of Agentic AI in cybersecurity. Agentic AI, a sophisticated form of LLM technology, will be illustrated using Langgraph and Gemini to extract and analyze data from the document titled "Coaching AI Agents: Why your next security hire might be an algorithm". The project will present both the strengths and limitations of Agentic AI.

One advantage of Agentic AI is its ability to summarize any document from the web or a PDF very efficiently in a few sentences. A limitation of Agentic AI is that it still requires human involvement to verify coding and properly implement steps in applications to ensure the chatbot functions correctly.


Computer skills: Langgraph and Gemini.
