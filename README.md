# Cybersecurity Risk: Agentic AI

## Project Overview:

This project explores the risks associated with Agentic AI in cybersecurity. Using Langgraph and Gemini, we analyze how Agentic AI extracts and processes information from the document "Coaching AI Agents: Why Your Next Security Hire Might Be an Algorithm." The project highlights both the strengths and limitations of this AI-driven approach.
hire might be an algorithm.

## Key Takeaways:

- Efficiency: Agentic AI excels at summarizing web documents and PDFs in just a few sentences, making information retrieval seamless.
- Human Oversight: Despite its capabilities, Agentic AI still requires human intervention for code verification and proper application integration to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used:

- Langgraph – Enables structured workflows and dynamic decision-making for AI-driven cybersecurity analysis.
- Gemini – Provides powerful AI-assisted data extraction and insight generation.
